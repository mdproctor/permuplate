# Permuplate Gap Analysis

**Source:** Analysis of the [Drools RuleBuilder DSL POC](https://github.com/mdproctor/drools/blob/droolsvol2/droolsvol2/src/test/java/org/drools/core/RuleBuilderTest.java)  
**Status:** Working document — items to be addressed in priority order

---

## Summary

Three categories of findings:

1. **Hard gaps** — things Permuplate fundamentally cannot do today and would require new features (G3 was initially identified as a hard gap but was incorrect — removed)
2. **Soft gaps** — things that almost work but have an awkward UX or a missing edge case
3. **Newly identified patterns** — patterns we can already support but haven't demonstrated or tested

---

## Hard Gaps

### G1 — Generic type parameter arity

**Status: Implemented** — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-01-generic-type-params-g1-design.md`

**What the Drools DSL needs:**
```java
// Type-safe filter: only compiles if fact types match
builder.filter((ctx, Person p, Account a) -> p.age() > 18);

// Underlying interface generated per arity:
interface Condition2<T1, T2> { boolean test(T1 fact1, T2 fact2); }
interface Condition3<T1, T2, T3> { boolean test(T1 fact1, T2 fact2, T3 fact3); }
```

**What Permuplate can generate:**
```java
// Erased version only — all facts are Object:
interface Condition2 { boolean test(Object fact1, Object fact2); }
```

**The gap:** Permuplate's variables are integers and strings. There is no mechanism to introduce Java generic type parameters that vary with the permutation variable. `Condition${i}<T1, T2, ..., T${i}>` cannot be expressed.

**Impact:** Generated interfaces are not type-safe. Users must cast. Viable for internal/scripting use cases, not for published type-safe APIs.

**Possible approach:** A new `@PermuteTypeParam` annotation or a `typeParams` attribute on `@Permute` that injects a comma-separated list of type parameter names. Needs design work.

### G4 — Named method series and method-level type parameter expansion

**Status: Implemented** — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-02-named-method-series-g4-design.md`

**What the Drools DSL needs:**
```java
// On JoinNSecond: path methods with different names, growing method type params, complex return types
<PB>       Path2<Join3First<..., Tuple2<C,PB>>,  Tuple1<C>,      C, PB>        path2()
<PB,PC>    Path3<Join3First<..., Tuple3<C,PB,PC>>,Tuple2<C,PB>,  C, PB, PC>    path3()
<PB,PC,PD> Path4<Join3First<..., Tuple4<C,...,PD>>,Tuple4<...>,  C, PB, PC, PD> path4()
```

**Three new capabilities required:**
1. `@PermuteMethod.name` — optional name template; generates distinct method names per inner loop value instead of same-name overloads
2. Method-level `@PermuteTypeParam` — driven by `@PermuteMethod`'s inner variable; introduces a third loop level (i → k → j)
3. `@PermuteReturn.typeArgs` — full JEXL template for the complete type argument list; handles mixed fixed + growing args that the existing loop mechanism cannot express

**Also resolves:** `extensionPoint()` returning `RuleExtendsPoint${i+1}<DS, T1,...,T${i}>` (mixed fixed + growing type args, previously a design gap).

**Depends on:** G1, G2, G3, N4

---

### G3 — Multi-join permutation (multiple overloads per class, two-variable boundary)

**Status: Implemented** — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-02-multi-join-g3-design.md`

**What the Drools DSL needs:**
```java
// From1First has join() overloads for +1, +2, +3 facts at once:
public <C>     Join2First<END,DS,B,C>     join(From1First<?,DS,C> fromC)
public <C,D>   Join3First<END,DS,B,C,D>   join(Join2Second<Void,DS,C,D> fromCD)
public <C,D,E> Join4First<END,DS,B,C,D,E> join(Join3First<Void,DS,C,D,E> fromCDE)
```

**The gap:** Permuplate can generate one method per class (G2). For each `Join${i}Second`, the Drools pattern requires *N* overloads of `join()` — one per valid step size j (1 ≤ j ≤ max−i). The parameter type, its type arguments, and the return type all vary with both `i` and `j`. Additionally, `Join${i}First extends Join${i}Second<T1..T${i}>` — the extends clause also carries type references that must grow per permutation.

**Three new capabilities required:**
1. `@PermuteMethod` — generates multiple method overloads per class using an inner loop variable `j`
2. `typeArgList(from, to, style)` — JEXL function for comma-separated type argument lists in `@PermuteDeclr.type`
3. Extends/implements clause expansion — same implicit inference as G2 return type inference applied to `extends`/`implements`

**Depends on:** G1, G2, N4

---

### G2 — Return type narrowing by arity (stateful builder types)

**Status: Implemented** — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-02-return-type-narrowing-g2-design.md`

**What the Drools DSL needs:**
```java
// After 1 join: builder knows it holds 1 fact
RuleBuilder<Ctx>.Step1<T1> step1 = builder.from(src);

// After 2 joins: builder knows it holds 2 facts
RuleBuilder<Ctx>.Step2<T1, T2> step2 = step1.join(src2);

// filter() on Step2 accepts Condition2<T1, T2>:
step2.filter((a, b) -> a.age() > b.age());
```

**The gap:** Each `.join()` call returns a different **type** that encodes the accumulated fact count in its generic signature. Generating `Step1`, `Step2`, `Step3`, ... is feasible with Permuplate (top-level classes), but the **return types** of the methods also need to reference the correct `Step${i+1}` type — which requires expressing "the next arity" as a type reference inside the template.

**Impact:** The fluent DSL cannot be type-safe end-to-end. The builder must erase to a raw type or use `Object`, losing compile-time safety on the final `filter()` and `fn()` call.

**Possible approach:** Allow `className` expressions to reference each other (`Step${i+1}`) or introduce a `nextClassName` attribute. Complex — needs design.

---

### ~~G3 — Overload selection by lambda arity~~ — NOT A GAP (removed)

**This was identified as a gap but was incorrect.** The Drools DSL compiles fine with same-named `filter()` overloads for different arities, which revealed the error in the original analysis.

Java's overload resolution for implicit-type lambdas considers the lambda's formal parameter count. From JLS 15.12.2.1, a lambda is "potentially compatible" with a functional interface only if the parameter counts match. When `filter(Condition2)` and `filter(Condition3)` are both candidates, a 2-parameter lambda `(a, b) -> ...` is only potentially compatible with `Condition2` (whose `test` takes 2 params), not with `Condition3`. The compiler narrows to exactly one candidate — no ambiguity.

**Permuplate's `@Permute` on a method already generates the correct overloads and Java resolves the call site correctly from the lambda arity.** No `methodName` attribute or differently-named methods are needed to solve this specific problem.

Note: `methodName` templating (N2) may still be useful for the `path2()`, `path3()` pattern where the depth is in the name by convention — but that is a style choice, not a compilation requirement.

---

## Soft Gaps

### S1 — `@Permute(inline=true)` on interfaces not tested

**Status: Resolved** — `InlineGenerationTest.testInlineGenerationWithInterfaceTemplate()` verifies that interface templates (abstract methods, no body, no constructor) generate correctly. The JavaParser AST handles `class` and `interface` uniformly with no edge cases.

---

### S2 — Two `@Permute(inline=true)` templates in the same parent class

**Status: Resolved** — `InlineGenerationTest.testTwoInterfaceTemplatesInSameParent()` verifies sequential processing: the second `InlineGenerator.generate()` call uses the output of the first as its parent CU, correctly merging both families into the same augmented parent. No conflicts.

---

### S3 — `PermuteMojo` still uses old `leadingLiteral` prefix check

**Status: Resolved** — `PermuteMojo.generateTopLevel()` now uses `AnnotationStringAlgorithm.matches()` (full substring matching), consistent with the APT processor. Fixed in the N4 implementation cycle.

**The issue:** `PermuteProcessor` (APT) now uses `AnnotationStringAlgorithm.matches()` for the `className` prefix check (full substring matching). `PermuteMojo` still uses the old `leadingLiteral` approach — extracting the text before the first `${` and checking `startsWith`. This means the validation is weaker and inconsistent between the two processing paths.

**Impact:** Low severity for now (the old check catches the most common mistakes). But as users write more complex `className` patterns (e.g., multi-literal like `"Foo${i}Bar${j}"`), the Mojo would silently accept things the APT would reject, and vice versa.

**Action needed:** Update `PermuteMojo.generateTopLevel()` to use `AnnotationStringAlgorithm.matches()` instead of `leadingLiteral`.

---

### S4 — `@PermuteParam` with `to="${i}"` generates 0 params when `i=1`

**Status: Resolved** — `PermuteParamTest.testPermuteParamEmptyRangeRemovesSentinel()` confirms: when `from > to` (e.g. `from="1", to="0"`), the sentinel is removed and the method has 0 parameters. The processor does not error — empty inner range is valid.

---

### S5 — The remaining `@Ignore` test in `PrefixValidationTest`

**Status: Resolved** — `@Ignore` removed. Variables `v1`, `v2`, `v3` declared via `strings={"v1=my", "v2=", "v3=2"}` in `@Permute`, making them available to JEXL at generation time. The rename is a no-op (produces the same name as the sentinel) but compilation succeeds cleanly. 0 skipped tests.

---

## Newly Identified Patterns (We Can Do, Haven't Demonstrated)

### N1 — Two independent permutation templates in one parent class

**What it is:** Two `@Permute`-annotated nested types inside the same parent, each generating a different family of siblings.

**Example:**
```java
public class RuleInterfaces {
    @Permute(varName="i", from=2, to=5, className="Condition${i}", inline=true, keepTemplate=true)
    public interface Condition1 { boolean test(@PermuteParam(...) Object fact1); }

    @Permute(varName="i", from=2, to=5, className="Action${i}", inline=true, keepTemplate=true)
    public interface Action1 { void execute(@PermuteParam(...) Object fact1); }
}
```

**Status:** Should work — the Maven plugin processes each `@Permute` annotation independently. **Not tested.** Needs the RuleInterfaces example to validate.

---

### N2 — `@Permute` on a method to generate depth-named overloads *(Resolved by G4)*

**Status: Resolved** — `@PermuteMethod.name` attribute (designed in G4) provides method name templating. The path use case (`path2()`, `path3()`, ...) is the primary example. No separate implementation needed beyond G4.

---

### N2 (original problem statement, kept for reference)

**What it is:** The Drools DSL has `path2()`, `path3()`, `path5()` as static factory methods with different names encoding their depth. This is the `@Permute on a method` pattern — generating N method overloads in one class.

**Example:**
```java
public class PathBuilder {
    @Permute(varName="i", from=2, to=10, className="PathBuilders")
    public static PathStep path${i}(Object... sources) { ... }
}
```

Wait — `@Permute` on a method uses `className` for the generated **class**, not the method name. The generated class contains all overloads. So `path2()` through `path10()` would need different method **names**, not just different parameter lists. Currently `@Permute` on a method generates a single class with N overloads of the **same method name** (differing in parameter count via `@PermuteParam`).

**Gap refinement:** To generate `path2()`, `path3()`, etc. with DIFFERENT names, we would need either:
- `@Permute` on a method where the method name itself is templated (e.g., `methodName = "path${i}"`)
- Or: one class per arity (the standard type permutation path), but that produces `PathBuilder2.java`, `PathBuilder3.java`, etc. as separate top-level classes

**Status:** This specific pattern (varying method name by arity) is **not currently supported**. It would need a new `methodName` attribute on `@Permute` when placed on a method.

---

### N4 — Expression language functions (`alpha`, `lower`, `typeArgList`)

**Status: Implemented** — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-02-expression-language-functions-n4-design.md`

**What it is:** Built-in functions registered in the JEXL engine and available in all string attributes. `alpha(n)` converts an integer to an uppercase letter (1-indexed: A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26); `lower(n)` converts to lowercase.

**Example:**
```java
// Single-letter type parameters — Drools-style
@PermuteReturn(typeArgVarName="j", typeArgFrom="1", typeArgTo="${i+1}", typeArgName="${alpha(j)}")
// → A, B, C, D, E instead of T1, T2, T3, T4, T5
```

**Status: Implemented** — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-02-expression-language-functions-n4-design.md`

**Why this matters:** N4 is the direct motivator for why `@PermuteReturn` exists as an explicit mechanism rather than relying solely on implicit inference. The Drools use case requires `alpha(j)` naming; explicit `@PermuteReturn` with N4 functions reproduces the hand-written Drools pattern exactly.

---

### N3 — `@PermuteParam` on interface abstract methods (not just class methods)

**What it is:** Using `@PermuteParam` to expand parameters on an interface method (abstract, no body). This is implicit in the RuleInterfaces example but hasn't been explicitly demonstrated.

**Example:**
```java
public interface Condition1 {
    boolean test(@PermuteParam(varName="j", from="1", to="${i}", 
                               type="Object", name="fact${j}") Object fact1);
}
```

**Status:** Should work — `PermuteParamTransformer` operates on `MethodDeclaration` regardless of whether it has a body. But abstract methods have no body, so the anchor expansion at call sites (the part that rewrites `c.test(fact1)` → `c.test(fact1, fact2, ...)`) is **not applicable** — there are no call sites inside the interface. This should silently no-op on the call-site expansion.

**Action needed:** Verify that `@PermuteParam` on an interface abstract method doesn't error when there are no call sites to expand.

---

## Future Enhancement TODOs (not yet prioritised)

### TODO-1 — `@PermuteParam` fully implicit via JavaParser inference

**Idea:** When a method parameter's type is a class type parameter following the `T${j}` naming convention (e.g., `T1 arg1`), infer `@PermuteParam` automatically — no annotation needed. `from` inferred from the numeric suffix of the type param (1); `to` inferred as `@Permute.varName` (the outer loop, since the expansion should match the class's type parameter count). Name template inferred if the parameter name also follows `name${j}` convention.

**Benefit:** Makes `Consumer${i}`, `Predicate${i}`, `Function${i}` family templates truly zero-annotation beyond `@Permute`.

**Complexity:** The coupling between type parameter expansion (G1) and parameter expansion (`@PermuteParam`) needs to be airtight. The `to` inference relies on the outer variable controlling both — valid when the expansion is 1:1 with class type params, but edge cases (different ranges, multiple sentinel params) need careful design.

**Status:** Deferred — value not yet clear enough to justify the design complexity.

---

### TODO-2 — Self-return inference via JavaParser

**Idea:** When a method's return type is the same class as the template class AND the return type's arguments are exactly the class's declared type parameters in order, automatically expand the return type to match the generated class. E.g., `filter()` returning `Join1First<END, DS, T1>` from `Join1First<END, DS, T1>` → becomes `Join3First<END, DS, T1, T2, T3>` for i=3. Zero false positives — exact same class with exact same args is unambiguous.

**Benefit:** Self-returning fluent methods (filter(), builder pattern) work without `@PermuteReturn`. Required for the JoinN family's filter() chain.

**Workaround until implemented:** Explicit `@PermuteReturn` on each self-returning method.

**Status:** Deferred — implement G1/G2 first; revisit once the core is working.

---

### TODO-4 — Move example tests into example module (test-jar reuse)

**Idea:** `ExampleTest` and `DogFoodingTest` currently live in `permuplate-tests/` but test templates from `permuplate-apt-examples/`. Tests should co-locate with what they test — `permuplate-apt-examples/src/test/java/`.

**The reuse question:** `ExampleTest` depends on `ProcessorTestSupport` (in `permuplate-tests`). Current preference: **reuse via test-jar dependency** rather than copying helpers. Publish `permuplate-tests` as a Maven `test-jar`; `permuplate-apt-examples` depends on it via `<type>test-jar</type>`. If that becomes awkward, revisit copying the small subset of helpers actually needed.

**Why it matters:** Tests in the module they test fail earlier in the build chain and give more precise signal on what broke.

**Work involved:** Add `src/test/java/` to `permuplate-apt-examples`, add test dependencies + test-jar dep to pom.xml, move the two test classes, update `templateSource()` to look in `src/main/java/`, remove duplicate template copies from `permuplate-tests/`.

**Status:** Deferred — reuse approach agreed, no urgency. Revisit when doing a module restructuring pass.

---

### TODO-3 — `@PermuteDeclr` implicit on fields and for-each variables

**Idea:** When a field's (or for-each variable's) type is a generated class whose numeric suffix matches the outer Permuplate variable value at the template base, infer `@PermuteDeclr` automatically. E.g., `Callable2 c2` in a `Join2` template (i=2) → infer `type="Callable${i}", name="c${i}"`. Only fires when type is in the generated set AND suffix matches — low false-positive risk.

**Benefit:** Removes `@PermuteDeclr` from field and for-each declarations in the common case.

**Workaround until implemented:** Explicit `@PermuteDeclr` on each field/for-each variable (already designed and working).

**Status:** Deferred — low enough impact that explicit annotations are not painful; revisit after core implementation.
